# LOL CARD GAME PLAN
## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY 

### HIGH PRIORITY
- Parsing of game data into card-like format
-* Allow for removing/adding of collected card stats
- Set up database to hold cards
-* Regard account creation / game state?

- Implement first version of game engine into front-end framework
- Implement app-user accounts
- Working implementation of simple card game with stat matching versus two users

### MIDDLE PRIORITY
- Implement card ranks and the rank-up wager
-* Normal card ranks
-* URF card ranks
-* NURF cards are stat half(?)

- Implement pre-round(1) card bURFfing / NURFing (requires normal + URF card types)
-* bURFing replaces normal card with URF card
-* NURFing is applied last, ontop of any current buffs. Reduces stats in a 'strategic' manner ;)
-* NURFing their bURFfed card allows you to bURF a *SECOND* card

- Implement summoner spell interaction
-* Summoners can be played pre-game
-* Summoners can be played mid-game 

- Alter game flow with map interaction
-* Map determines which 'card battles' are performed, pre-round(1) you perhaps assign cards to defend specific locations (turrets)
-* Your round allows you to select the objective and a card
-* The card battle proceeds against the pre-defined defense versus the attack

### LOW PRIORITY
- Game sound

### WISH LIST
